# babyreactredux
Just react, redux, and an express server (also sass).

This will get you started on React and Redux without having to sift through a million tutorials (hopefully).

To get started, run `npm install`

To make changes, edit files in src folder, then run `sh local-build.sh`

To run server, cd to server folder and run `node index.js`

That's it.
